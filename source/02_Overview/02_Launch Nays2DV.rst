Launch Nays2DV
===================

The following is the procedure to launch Nays2DV in iRIC.

When launching iRIC, the iRIC start page can be seen as :numref:`image_create_new_project_1`.
Click on [Create New Project] in the [iRIC Start Page] window.

.. _image_create_new_project_1:

.. figure:: images/create_new_project_1.png
   :width: 400pt

   : Create new project_1 

Then the [Select Solver] window will open as shown in :numref:`image_create_new_project_2`. Select [Nays2DV vertical 2D model] in the [Select Solver] window and click on [OK].

.. _image_create_new_project_2:

.. figure:: images/create_new_project_2.png
   :width: 450pt

   : Create new project_2 

A window with the title bar untitled-iRIC 3.0.18.6257 [Nays2DV vertical 2D model] will appear as shown in :numref:`image_create_new_project_3`.

.. _image_create_new_project_3:

.. figure:: images/create_new_project_3.png
   :width: 350pt

   : Create new project_3

Nays2DV model is ready to use.

 The basic steps to follow during a simulation in Nays2DV are,
  1. Creation of the grid
  2. Mapping the attributes to the grids
  3. Setting the calculation conditions 
  4. Making a simulation
  5. Visualization of results
